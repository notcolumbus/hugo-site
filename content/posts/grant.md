## My research Grant got Selected!!!!
Surreal experience. I still remember writing our proposal at 4 AM three hours before it was due :/ 
Now we’ve actually got funding to cover our cloud credits and research studies. Future get ready for automated spatial audio, will write a blog(a detailed one) on what we are doing exactly. Initial deails can be found here https://idpro-lander.vercel.app
