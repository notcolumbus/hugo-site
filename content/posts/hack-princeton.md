Im actually shaking writing this!!! Gonna keep it short ‘cause I seriously need sleep lol but big motion at Princeton this weekend.

We took home 3 prizes, met a ton of amazing people, and yes, I finally had something called a hoagie (life-changing). My highlight would be working with all the sponsors, loved debugging imessage problems with Daniel and chatting with Noah and Enea about how we actually hit prod and got my real financial data on our project and about Noah's amazing idea to make an mcp server for the whole internet.
