## Marriott Codefest

Wohoo!! We won and got 2nd place!

Still can’t believe it, had an amazing time chatting with the Marriott VPs, especially Lak and Devesh (they’re seriously some of the most humble and genuine people I’ve met, love them).

Also met the HokieBird and Ringo the pony, which honestly is the highlight. Oh, and I may or may not have demolished some 5 star hotel food while we were at it
